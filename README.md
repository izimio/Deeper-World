# Deeper-World

An horrible way to create a video game. But this was my first personal project.

This repo contain the game i made "Deeper World"

Basicaly, this is a rogue like with fight like pokemon with an ounce of humor.

Containing a tons of easter eggs and private jokes. 

### In this game you will be able to travel trought 3 differents world a face vilains such as : 
- Lord soupex
  - A massive Troll that will test your faith with an epic rock paper cissor ! 
- Voltrexx
  - A huge sand worm that you will encounter inside the ruins of a deserted land !
- Diomikos
  - The final boss of the last world AKA __"L'avenue des d√©chus"__ ! This is a semi-god that will give you a hard time ! 
- 3 secrets bosses such as 
  - The coin stealer 
  - The guardian
  - The vendor
  
#### In this horrible project i made saves by creating files ! so you will need to create an empty file called __"saves"__ on your desktop to be able to play the game ! 

----------------------------------------

And that's it !! 

*BTW this is a non-function file with a main that has 24K lines :)*
