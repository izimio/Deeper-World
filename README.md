# Deeper-World

An horrible way to create a video game. But this was my first personal project.

This repo contain the games i made "Dungeon Deeper" and "Deeper World"

Basicaly, this is a rogue like with fight like pokemon with an ounce of humor.

Containing a tons of easter eggs and private jokes. 

BTW this is a non-function file with a main that has 24K lines :)
